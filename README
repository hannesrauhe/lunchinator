ONLY TESTED ON UBUNTU ATM

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
=======
sudo apt-get install sox libnotify-bin expect-dev

USAGE UBUNTU
============

execute (Alt-F2 recommended) start_notifier.sh

USAGE
=====
If you want to be notified for lunch, 
1. add your machine to the lunch_members text file and push the changes to the git repository.
2. execute python lunch_server

If you want to notify the lunch_members, that it's time for lunch:
execute python lunch_client

Please pull the newest version from the git repository from time to time to update your local lunch_members file and security fixes

HOW IT WORKS
============
lunch_server listens on incoming UDP connections on Port 50000
ATM it will not parse incoming messages - it will simply open/close your DVD and play a sound
