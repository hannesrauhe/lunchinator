INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
=======
 sudo apt-get install sox libnotify-bin

Open Up port 50000/UDP on your machine
Additionally open Up port 50001/TCP on your machine


USAGE
=============

execute (Alt-F2 recommended) start_lunchinator.py

first time usage:
*write a hostname/IP of one of the lunch peers (e.g. luder) to the right bottom text field, click on "add host" and wait a few seconds
OR
*another peer/colleague can add your hostname/IP to its list the same way

PLUGINS
=======

Most of the functionality you can see is implemented in Plugins. The core program does just relay/store messages and finds peers.

*activated by default:
-General Settings (to be able to change settings via GUI)
-Notify (to open/close optical drive, show a notification (depends on libnotify) and play a sound on linux (depends on sox)
-Avatar (to set a picture as your avatar - you can see other pictures in the norification without this plugin)

Details
======

start_lunchinator.py will start 
*an appindicator on Ubuntu 10.04 and newer, (bin/indicator_applet.py 
*a GTK tray icon on any system, where pyGTK is available (bin/gui_tray.py)
*or the CLI version, if no GTK is available (bin/nogui.py)

The start_lunchinator.py script also pulls changes from the git repository on start and updates/restarts the lunchinator,
if somebody called "HELO_UPDATE smth"

The indicator plugin will install its icons to the ubuntu theme directory (after asking)

Configuration is done by adding/modifying files to/in the .lunchinator dir in your home or via GUI (Settings).
Logs are stored in ~/.lunchinator/lunchinator.log

lunch_server listens on incoming UDP connections on Port 50000
ATM it will not parse incoming messages - it will simply show a notice (and open/close your DVD and play a sound at lunch time)
(Exception: Messages starting with HELO are there to communicate user names etc.)
From time to time, the lunch_server will write all members to lunch_members.cfg
