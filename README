ONLY TESTED ON UBUNTU ATM

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
=======
sudo apt-get install sox libnotify-bin expect-dev

USAGE UBUNTU
============

execute (Alt-F2 recommended) start_notifier.sh
output will be logged to .lunch_calls

Details
=====
The bash script pulls the newest version from git and executes the indicator applet on ubuntu and the general tray icon on every other system (pygtk needed)

CLI
===

You can also start lunch_server.py in a console and watch the output there, to call for lunch you can execute lunch_client.py <message>


HOW IT WORKS
============
lunch_server listens on incoming UDP connections on Port 50000
ATM it will not parse incoming messages - it will simply open/close your DVD and play a sound
(Exception: Messages starting with HELO are there to communicate user names etc.)

lunch_client sends a message to all clients that are in the lunch_members file (which is in the git repository)
additional all clients that announce theirself will get a message as well (doesn't work from cli, only from gui)

the other *.py-files are there for the gui/tray-icon/indicator-applet
