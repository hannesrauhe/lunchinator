USAGE
=============

execute (Alt-F2 recommended) start_lunchinator.py

first time usage:
*write a hostname/IP of one of the lunch peers (e.g. luder) to the right bottom text field, click on "add host" and wait a few seconds
OR
*another peer/colleague can add your hostname/IP to its list the same way

PLUGINS
=======

Most of the functionality you can see is implemented in Plugins. The core program does just relay/store messages and finds peers.

for example:
-General Settings (to be able to change settings via GUI)
-Notify (to open/close optical drive, show a notification (depends on libnotify) and play a sound on linux (depends on sox)
-Avatar (to set a picture as your avatar - you can see other pictures in the norification without this plugin)

Details
======

Use ./start_lunchinator.py --help to see additional options, e.g., a pure command line version and a server version.

Updates are handled via Git. You can use the auto update instead plugin if you do not have git.

lunch_server listens on incoming UDP connections on Port 50000
ATM it will not parse incoming messages - it will simply show a notice (and open/close your DVD and play a sound at lunch time)
(Exception: Messages starting with HELO are there to communicate user names etc.)
