INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
=======
 sudo apt-get install sox libnotify-bin expect-dev

Open Up port 50000/UDP on your machine


USAGE WITH GUI
=============

execute (Alt-F2 recommended) start_notifier.sh
output will be logged to .lunch_calls

first time usage:
click on the icon (RSS-standard icon next to the clock) and on "Show/Send Messages"
write a hostname/IP of one of the lunch peers (e.g. luder) to the right bottom text field, click on "add host" and wait a few seconds

CLI
===
If you don't have a GUI or no pyGTK, you can also use the CLI.
Before you start, check if you have a lunch_members.cfg file with at least one peer. If you don't have one:

 echo "luder" >> lunch_members.cfg

start the server:
 lunch_server.py 

to send a call:
 lunch_client.py <message>

CONFIG
======
Put your username in username.cfg.
If you want another sound-file put a wav-file to the sounds-dir and write the filename to sound.cfg

Details
======
The bash script pulls the newest version from git and executes the indicator applet on ubuntu and the general tray icon on every other system (pygtk needed)

HOW IT WORKS
============
lunch_server listens on incoming UDP connections on Port 50000
ATM it will not parse incoming messages - it will simply show a notice (and open/close your DVD and play a sound at lunch time)
(Exception: Messages starting with HELO are there to communicate user names etc.)
From time to time, the lunch_server will write all members to lunch_members.cfg

lunch_client sends a message to all clients that are in the lunch_members.cfg file (which is in the git repository)
additional all clients that announce theirself will get a message as well (doesn't work from cli, only from gui)

the other *.py-files are there for the gui/tray-icon/indicator-applet
