The Lunchinator: a tool to call your colleagues for lunch

<Shortcut Download links>

What is the lunchinator?

The Problem -> Our Solution
1. You and your colleagues are in different offices but meet for lunch almost every day. Around twelve o'clock you get hungry and walk by every office to inform the others that it is time for lunch. In every office you wait for a few seconds until everyone is finally on his feet and ready to go.
->
Instead of this you and your colleagues can just start the lunchinator in the morning. If you feel like it you set up your preferred lunch time. When you are hungry, you hit the button and everyone is notified. Of course you can also add a short message.
No further setup or registration is needed. You just start it up and leave it running. 

2. Every day you and your colleagues have to agree on the restaurant, canteen or imbiss for lunch.
->
Just use the voter plugin and wait for someone to suggest place and time or suggest one yourself. You immediately see the favourite spot without leaving your chair.

If you are in a big company that has a webcam in the canteen or the lunch menu on a website you can easily integrate this into the lunchinator.
