- Problem when launching start_lunchinator and there is no .lunchinator directory
- Problem when the members cfg is empty (division by zero)
- thread safety in lunch_server through signals
- unicode support
- lunch menu structured: tooltips
- search for TODOs
- Sent messages appear twice
- avatar: Image durch Qt-Zeug ersetzen
- avatar: discard implementieren
